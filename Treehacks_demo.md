# TREEHACKS WORDLE REACT BUILD ALONG!!!

1. Create a new React app
```
npx create-react-app treehacks-wordle
cd treehacks-wordle
npm start
```

2. Install some dependencies

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled reshake styled-components
```

3. Add this to the head of your `public/index.html` (We will need it later)

```
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/3.0.5/seedrandom.min.js"></script>
```

4. The last thing we want to do is actually to get a list of wordle words. This is easier if you just download the file that I have [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ypat125/THordle/main/src/assets/wordle_words.js). Store it at called `src/assets/wordle_words.js`.
